/**
 * The `settings.plugin.item` slot type — one plugin's card inside the
 * configurable-plugins tab, keyed by the settings namespace the card edits.
 * Options: `key` (the namespace). A card draws its own internals; the tab only
 * decides which namespaces to dispatch and stacks what comes back.
 *
 * Keying on the namespace is what lets a plugin distributed outside this
 * repository contribute a card: it registers its own settings namespace on the
 * Host and its own card under that key in the browser, and the tab pairs the
 * two without ever learning what the namespace means.
 *
 * TYPE HOME RATIONALE: the tab declares this slot at runtime, and a plugin
 * registering its own card already depends on this package for the slot's
 * declaration. The type therefore lives with its declarer.
