## Summary

This package renders the background-job surface of the Web GUI: a session-header action whose popover lists the jobs this session can see, and a right-Sidebar tab listing the same rows in a panel that stays open. It reads host-computed registry state through the runtime's `jobsBySession` mirror and issues no RPC. The header trigger appears only once the session has a job, badged with the running and stopping count; settled rows stay visible and de-emphasized until the registry drops them. The model's view of the same jobs belongs to `dsh-tool-jobs`; this is a read-only projection for the human.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin alongside the runtime; the job action then appears in the session header whenever the session has at least one job. A click opens the popover: live rows first by start time, then settled rows by finish time, each showing the producer kind, label, status, and an elapsed duration that ticks once per second while live and freezes at completion.

With the right Sidebar composed, the same list is also a Sidebar tab: open it from the Sidebar's guide page (**Background jobs**) to keep the rows on screen while the work runs, instead of holding a popover open. The tab is the one surface that renders on an empty session, where it says the session has run nothing yet.

### Dismissal and limits

Escape closes the list and returns focus to the trigger, as does a pointer press outside it. The list shows what one session can see through the wire view, so a job owned by another session never appears here; a process restart empties the list while the transcript keeps the `run_in_background` cards that started those jobs.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The package contributes one entry to `conversation.session.header.actions` (`JobListAction`) and, when `sidebarRightTabs` is composed, one right-Sidebar tab type (`jobsDefinition`) with its body and chip title (`JobsBody`, `JobsTitle`) under the type id. Both surfaces draw `JobRows`, so ordering, durations, and status wording have one home. The data arrives entirely through the `jobsBySession` list mirror that the Session Controller binding folds from `session/jobs` frames — no RPC, and no state beyond popover visibility. The badge counts `running` plus `stopping` and is omitted at zero. Rows are ordered with live rows first by `startedAt` ascending, then settled rows by `finishedAt` descending, with a same-millisecond tie broken on start order; a settled row missing `finishedAt` reads as zero rather than as a negative figure, and a duration past an hour stays in hours. Settled rows stay visible because a failed job's `detail` is the only place its failure is legible. The behavior is specified by the [Web background-job display Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-08-08-web-background-job-display.md).

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the job surface is not enough. They move from the browser list to the registry and the model-facing tool.

- [dsh-tool-jobs](../../jobs/tool-jobs/README.md) — the model-facing jobs tool over the same registry.
- [Session Controller](../../api/session-controller/README.md) — folds the `jobsBySession` mirror this package reads.
- [ui-subagent](../ui-subagent/README.md) — the subagent catalog, where a running one-shot background subagent also appears.
- [Web client architecture](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.md) — how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as this package renders host-computed registry state for a human and touches no prompt, message, schema, stream, or tool result.

#### KV Cache effect

None; the package never assembles or sends provider requests.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current job list. They are current package constraints, not a general job-management comparison or a task backlog.

- **Rows are read-only** — a job's streamed output and a human-initiated cancellation are separate phases. Cancellation additionally owes a model-facing decision the seam does not answer: `kill()` marks terminal delivery reported, so an interrupt written against the current contract would leave the model believing its job is still running.
- **The list is not the registry's own set** — it shows what one session can see through the wire view, so a job owned by another session never appears here, and a process restart empties the list while the transcript keeps the `run_in_background` cards that started those jobs. An unowned job (one started without a live `Agent`) reaches every session's list, matching what `list(caller)` reports to every caller.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. This package is a read-only projection of the `jobsBySession` mirror onto one header slot entry. It emits no Cordis events, owns no cross-plugin mutable state, and its single slot registration proves disposal through the HMR-safety spec.
